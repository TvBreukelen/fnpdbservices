FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions (in random order)

1. Who are you?
--------------
I'm a Dutchman; born in Amsterdam in 1962. Grew up in a small village near
Amsterdam. Studied marketing and economics, but found a job in IT instead. In
1992 I left the Netherlands to work in France. 2,5 years later the company I
worked for, moved to Switzerland, so I went there as well. In Switzerland I fell
in love with my current wife. In 2001 we decided to move to Germany and got
married there. Currently I'm working in Wiesbaden as a software engineer for
an insurance company.


2. Why do I need the Java run-time?
----------------------------------
FNProg2PDA and DBConvert are written in Java, which means that they need the
Java run-time to execute the program code. Some technical information: all what
FNProg2PDA.exe, DBConvert.exe, FNProg2PDA_NoGUI.exe or DBConvert_NoGUI.exe does
is to execute the Java program Javaw with the FNProg2PDA.jar, DBConvert.jar,
FNProg2PDA_NoGUI.jar or DBConvert_NoGUI.jar as parameter. 

Note: Javaw is a program included in the Java run-time to run a Java application
without a console window under MS-Windows, Linux or Apple OS. 


3. Which JAVA run-time version do I need?
----------------------------------------
JAVA JRE 8.0 or higher.


4. How do I install the program?
--------------------------------
On a Windows PC:
- run the installation program and follow the instructions on screen.

On a Mac:
- open the installation DMG file and drag the opened folder in the Applications
  Folder

On a Linux PC
- unzip the installation zip file into a directory of your liking.
- grant DBConvert.jar/FNProg2PDA.jar execute rights


5. What is the main difference between the Windows and Mac/Linux versions?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only the Windows versions are capable of creating a HanDBase database directly
(with the help of the HanDBase Desktop companion program for Windows). 

This means that if you'd want to export to HanDbase from your Mac or Linux PC,
you'll have to export to a CSV file instead and manually import that CSV file
in HanDBase.


6. I have a database program that is not on the list of supported databases,
   can I still use DBConvert or FNProg2PDA?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This depends on whether your database program has the option to import from
a text file, an xBase database, a MS-Excel spreadsheet or XML File. If that is
the case then you are in luck, because DBConvert and FNProg2PDA support many
text formats, MS-Excel, XML, Dbase III, IV and IV as well as FoxPro.


7. What is the difference between DBConvert standalone program and the DBConvert
   Tool that is included FNProg2PDA?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no difference. Both programs share the same code base. If you're happy
to use DBConvert from within FNProg2PDA then there is no need to install
DBConvert separately.


8. Why don't you support my PDA database product X?
--------------------------------------------------
Due to the huge amount of database products that are available on the market it
is practically impossible to support them all. For that reason I only intend to
support the most common databases in the field.

In some cases the structure of the PDA database is a trade secret and has
therefore not been made available to the public. As long as the creators of that
database don't provide their own means of importing data from external
sources then there is nothing that I can do to support their product. 


9. Where can I find more information about DBConvert or FNProg2PDA?
------------------------------------------------------------------
DBConvert and FNProg2PDA are hosted on SourceForge. For technical support
check out:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbconvert or 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fnprog2pda

There you can also find information about forthcoming versions as well as the
latest (pre)releases of the programs.

If you are interested in the source code then have a look at:

10. What are your plans with DBConvert and FNProg2PDA for the future?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This depends mainly on the feedback that I get back from you and other users as
well as to the amount of spare time I can allocate to the projects in the future.
You have to keep in mind that DBConvert and FNProg2PDA are currently
maintained by me only and that I have a "real" job and a family too.


11. Are you making money with DBConvert or FNProg2PDA?
-----------------------------------------------------
No, but it's always appreciated when someone send a simple note saying "thank
you" (or any comments). It did take a huge amount of time to work on the
DBConvert and FNProg2PDA programs, ironing out bugs and adding features.

If you think that this effort has been worthwhile for you and perhaps consider
to give something back then I would like to suggest that you donate that money
to one of your own favorite charities.


12. How can I contact you?
-------------------------
For all support questions that are related to FNProg2PDA or DBConvert, you could
drop me a line at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fnprog2pda or at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbconvert


13. How do I report a bug?
--------------------------
Whenever DBConvert or FNProg2PDA cannot handle a particular situation, it will
pop-up an error message screen that offers the option to copy the error messages
 to the clipboard. You could then post a support message on this forum with the
pasted information from your clipboard (ctrl+v).
  
Best thing though is to keep your FNProg2PDA and DBConvert versions updated to
the latest release, because occasionally you may stumble over a bug that has
already been fixed before.
