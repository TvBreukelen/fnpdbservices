<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Standard</b></li>
This setting let you import iCalendar files created according to the iCalendar standard<br>
<br>
<li><b>Lotus Notes</b></li>
This will improve the compatibility with Lotus Notes generated iCalendar files, especially 
 regarding client- and domain mappings.
<br><br>
<li><b>Outlook</b></li>
When activated it enforces a folding length of 75 characters (by default DBConvert will fold at
 73 characters). It allows for spaces when parsing a WEEKDAY list.<br>
</ul>
<h3>Parsing Validation</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Relaxed Parsing</b></li>
This option is intended as a general relaxation of parsing rules to allow for parsing otherwise
 invalid calendar files. Initially enabling this property will allow for the creation of properties
 and components with illegal names (e.g. Mozilla Calendar's "X" property).<br>
 <br>
<li><b>Relaxed Unfolding</b></li>
You can relax DBConvert unfolding rules by activating this option. Some Mozilla-, Linux- and Unix
 based calendar apps use the non-standard LF instead of CRLF characters to fold long lines of text.
<br><br>
<li><b>Relaxed Validation</b></li>
When activated DBConvert becomes more lenient toward interpreting missing or faulty time zones in the
 iCalender files.
