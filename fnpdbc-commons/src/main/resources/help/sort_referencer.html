<h2>P. Referencer Field Definition</h2>
A P. Referencer database is structured similar to a book in the sense that the database is also
 divided up into individual chapters. The contents of a chapter can be divided in separate paragraphs,
 which helps you design your chapters in a more clearly structured manner. Finally, a chapter or
 paragraph contains a text area. Normally the first line of the text area contains something that
 clearly identifies the database record in database, like the title (of a book, film, etc.).
 FNProg2PDA allows you to assign individual database fields of the original database to the
 Referencer Chapter, Paragraph and/or Title structure.

<h3>Re-Sort (DBConvert only)</h3>
This little insignificant looking checkbox has an huge impact on how DBConvert creates your new
 P. Referencer database. When selected then DBConvert sorts the records to be converted by
 "Chapter", "Paragraph", "Title" and "Title(Text)" field. If the original database is already
 correctly sorted then it is better to deactivate the checkbox, because that reduces memory
 consumption and processing time.
<br><br>
 
<h3>Chapter</h3>
Here you should select a database field that you'd like to use as chapter in your P. Referencer
 database. The Chapter field is optional. If defined then Chapter Field MUST be sorted, because
 the P. Referencer database format doesn't accept duplicate chapter names.
<br><br>

<h3>Paragraph</h3>
Here you can select the field that should be used as a "container" for the text that follows. The
 field should be a sorted field in order to make any sense. The Paragraph field is optional.
<br><br>

<h3>Title</h3>
The Title field is the first field that you'd like to write in a chapter or paragraph. Most likely
 this is the title of a book, film or whatever. The Title field is optional.
<br><br>

<h3>Title(Text)</h3>
This field extends the Text field. When the value of Title(Text) doesn't match the value in the
 Title Field then it is added to the Title field in parenthesis. The Title(Text) field is optional.
<br>
<p><b>Example:</b> Title Field = "Title", Title(Text) = "Original Title"<br>
result = "Haikerens Guide til Galaksen (Hitchhiker's  Guide to the Galaxy)"
