<h2>XML Field Definition</h2>

An XML file is structured in a tree like fashion. From the root-element, defined in the PDA Database Name field on the
 previous screen, elements "sprout" from the root-element like leaves on a tree.
<br><br>

<h3>Re-Sort (DBConvert only)</h3>
This little insignificant looking checkbox has an huge impact on how DBConvert creates your new xml file. When selected,
 DBConvert sorts the records to be exported by element. If the original import file is already correctly sorted then it is
 better to deactivate the checkbox, because that reduces memory consumption and processing time.
<br><br>

<h3>Elements</h3>
In this screen you can define up to 4 fields to be used as sorted element. Each field you choose here, acts as an container
 for the elements to follow.
<br><br>

<h3>Example</h3>
Imagine that you are exporting a Books database, a logical element sort order would then be:<br><br>

Element 1: Author<br>
Element 2: Series<br>
Element 3: Title

<p>The result would then be something like this:</p>
