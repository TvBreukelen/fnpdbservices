<h2>XML Field Definition</h2>

An XML file is structured in a tree like fashion. From the root-element, defined in the PDA Database Name field on the
 previous screen, elements "sprout" from the root-element like leaves on a tree.
<br>

<h3>Elements</h3>
In this screen you can sort up to 4 different elements. If you've defined the same object on the "Export Fields" tab, the
 program will use the field header instead of the field name itself. 
<br>

<h3>Group by</h3>
If you not only want to sort the objects, but group them as well then you should activate the checkbox
 that follows the sorted element fields.
