<h1>Export To HanDBase</h1>
<h2>Export Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Into New Database</b></li>
This option creates a new database. Should a previous copy of the "Export To" database file already exist then
 DBConvert/FNprog2PDA will overwrite it.
<br>
<li><b>Into Current Database, Replacing current records</b></li>
Should the "Export To" HandBase database already exist then this option will keep the database structure of the
 existing file intact, but replaces the already existing records in the database with the new records found in the
 "Export From" Database".
<br>
<li><b>Into Current Database, Appending to existing records</b></li>
Similar as the previous option, but in this case the new records are appended to the existing records in the 
 database.
<br>
<li><b>Password</b></li>
Optional password. If an existing HanDBase database has a password then you are no longer prompted for the password 
 if you've entered it here.
<br>
</ul>
<h2>Convert</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Convert Images to Image files</b></li>
By activating this checkbox all images to be exported are converted to image files. This allows you to import 
 these images in your HanDBase database. To import the image filename (instead of the actual image), leave the 
 checkbox deactivated.
<ol>
<li><i><b>To Bitmap Files</b></i></li>
Exports the images to .bmp (bitmap) files. These files are directly imported in the HanDBase database and are
  show there as "thumbnails".<br>
<li><i><b>To Jpeg Files (160x160 pixels)</b></i></li>
This option is only suitable in case you've got the HanDBase Image-Plugin installed. The Image-Plugin supports
  .jpg (Jpeg) Files of 160 x 160 bytes or 320 x 320 bytes. This option creates the images files of max.160 x 160
  pixel-size.<br>
<li><i><b>To Jpeg Files (320x320 pixels)</b></i></li> 
Same as above, but by selecing this option Jpeg files will be created that have a imagesize of max. 320 x 320 pixels.<br>
</ol>
<p><b>Important:</b> the image conversion process takes a huge amount of processing time!<br>
When you export to Jpeg file, you have to keep in mind that you'd need to copy the files manually to your PDA in
the folder specified under Config->General->Folders->PDA Image Folder.  
</p>

<br>
</ul>
<h2>HanDBase Import</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Field Order of Fields</b></li>
Import the new records based on the field order (as in the HanDBase 'Edit Field Order' screen.
<br>
<li><b>Physical Order of Fields</b></li>
Import the new records data based on the field creation order, as in the HanDBase 'DB Properties' screen
<p><b>Note</b>: The HanDBase Import options can only be used if you export to an existing database (= one
 of the Export "InTo Current Database" options).</p>
</ul> 
     
<h2>AutoInstall</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>All Users</b></li>
Install database for all Palm users that are set up for Palm Hotsync<br>
<li><b>Palm User</b></li>
Here you enter the name of a Palm user that is set up for Palm Hotsync. The database is then installed
 automatically for that particular user
</ul>

<br>

Here you will need to specify the fully qualified filename of the HanDBase database conversion program
 (handbasedesktop.exe). The Browse button allows you to find this program on your PC more easily.
