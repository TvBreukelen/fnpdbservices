<h1>Export Filter</h1>
The Export Filter allows you to export only those records that meet a certain criteria. You can
 setup two filters and an editional filter on a keyword and contents. If you've used the "Simple
 Search" feature in the <b>FNProgramvare</b> software before then this should cause you no headaches.
<p>
The define a filter, proceed as follows<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Select the field that you'd like to filter on from the drop-down list on the left</li>
<li>Select the operator from the drop-down list on the right.</li> 
<li>Specify the value you want to search for.<br>
   If you want to combine two filter fields, continue with step 4. If not, proceed to step 8.</li> 
<li>From the drop-down list in the box below, select the second field you want to filter on.</li>
<li>Select the operator from the drop-down list on the right.</li> 
<li>Specify the value you want to search for.</li>
<li>Specify whether you want to combine the two fields with the <b>AND</b> operator or the <b>OR</b> operator
  by selecting either AND or OR.</li>
<li>If you'd want to apply an additonal <b>Keyword</b> filter on your BookCAT, CATraxx, StampCAT or SoftCAT
 database then select the value you want to search for from the drop-down list in the <b>Keyword Filter</b> box
<li>If you'd want to apply an additonal <b>Contents Type</b> filter (BookCAT and CATVids databases only)
 then select the value you want to search for from the drop-down list in the <b>Contents Type Filter</b> box.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>You can deactivate the filter(s) by setting the <b>Database Field</b> to the blank line in the list or by pressing the

</li>
<li>If you are using two filters then use the <b>AND</b> or <b>OR</b> operators with care. For example:
 if you like to export all albums of Kate Bush and Michael Jackson from a CATraxx database, you should
 use the <b>OR</b> operator. Should you select the <b>AND</b> operator it means that you yould like to
 export all albums that Kate Bush and Michael Jackson have made together.
<li>The <b>Contents Type</b> filter could be very useful for to export one particular type of Contents (like
 Magazine Articles only). 
</ul>
