<h2>XML Field Definition</h2>
An XML file is structured in a tree like fashion. From the root-element, defined in the PDA Database Name field on the
 previous screen, elements "sprout" from the root-element like leaves on a tree.<br><br>
 
In this screen you can define up to 4 fields to be used as sorted element. Each field you choose here, acts as an container
 for the elements to follow. Imagine for example that you are exporting a Books database, a logical element sort order would
 then be:<br>

<p>
Element 1: Author<br>
Element 2: Series<br>
Element 3: Title
</p> 

<p>The result would then be something like this:</p>
