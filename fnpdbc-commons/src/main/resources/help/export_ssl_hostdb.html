<h2>SSL</h2>
If your user has been setup by the database administrator to use SSL then here you can
 define which certificates DBConvert should use to connect to the database. You can setup
 DBConvert to use a one way or two way connection. Which one to use depends on the database
 and user configuration.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Use SSL</h3>
If you don't need to use SSL then leave this check box deactivated. If SSL is required you
 you'd need to activate it.
<br>
<br>
<h3>SSL mode</h3>
Indicate SSL demand. Possible values include disable, allow, prefer, require, verify-ca and
 verify-full for PostGreSQL and disable, trust, verify-ca and verify-full for MariaDB/MySQL. 
<p>
- require, allow, prefer and trust all default to a non validating SSL factory and do not check the
 validity of the certificate or the host name.<br> 
- verify-ca validates the certificate, but does not verify the hostname.<br> 
- verify-full will validate that the certificate is correct and verify the host connected to
 </p>
 has the same hostname as the certificate. 
 Default is "prefer" for PostgresSQL and "trust" for MariaDB/MySQL.
<h3>KeyStore file</h3>
File path of the keyStore file that contain client private key store and associate certificates
<h3>KeyStore password</h3>
Password for the client certificate keyStore
<h3>SSL server certificate</h3>
Permits providing server's certificate in DER form, or server's CA certificate (MariaDB/MySQL).
 The server will be added to trustStore. This permits a self-signed certificate to be trusted.
<h3>SSL CA certificate</h3>
File name of the SSL root certificate. It can be a PEM encoded X509v3 certificate
