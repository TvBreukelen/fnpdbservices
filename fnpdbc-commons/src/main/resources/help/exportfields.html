<h2>Export Fields</h2>
In this Table you can see the database fields to be exported and their types. The "Export From"
 fields are the field names that you've selected from the "Available Fields" List, the "Export To" fields are the Field names for the export file.
 In "Text Export" you could tell the program to convert certain fields from boolean, date or time to text (as defined in the General Settings). 
  
<p>
<b>Notes:</b> You can select or deselect more than one field like in the "Available Fields" List. You can edit a "Export To" Field by double clicking
 on it. After you've typed in your changes, you should however either press the
 Enter key (or click once again on the table with the mouse) to keep your
 changes.<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> If the "Export To" field name, doesn't match the export file criteria then the program will try to enforce the export file standard. For
 example if you are exporting to a DBase file then the program will truncate
 the field name to a maximum of 10 characters and convert the lowercase
 characters in the field name to uppercase.
