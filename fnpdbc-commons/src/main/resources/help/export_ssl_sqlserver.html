<h2>SSL</h2>
If your user has been setup by the database administrator to use SSL then here you can
 define which certificates DBConvert should use to connect to the database. You can setup
 DBConvert to use a one way or two way connection. Which one to use depends on the database
 and user configuration.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Use SSL</h3>
If you don't need to use SSL then leave this check box deactivated. If SSL is required you
 you'd need to activate it.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Encrypt and Trust Server Certificate</h3>
When Encrypt is set to true and Trust Server Certificate check box is selected then
 DBConvert won't validate the SQL Server TLS certificate. This setting is common for allowing
 connections in test environments, such as where the SQL Server instance has only a self-signed
 certificate.<br><br>
One should therefore never activate the Trust Server Certificate in a production environment.
<br><br>
When Encrypt is set to true and Trust Server Certificate property is not activated, DBConvert
 will validate the SQL Server TLS certificate. Validating the server certificate is a part
  of the TLS handshake and ensures that the server is the correct server to connect to. To
  validate the server certificate, the trust material must be supplied at connection time
  either by using the KeyStore file and Key Store Password explicitly, or  by using the
  underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM)'s default trust store implicitly.
 <h3>KeyStore file</h3>
specifies the path (including filename) to the certificate trustStore file, which contains the
 list of certificates that the client trusts.
 <h3>KeyStore password</h3>
 The KeyStore password specifies the password used to check the integrity of the keyStore data
 <h3>Host name in certificate</h3>
 Specifies the host name of the server. The value of this property must match the subject
  property of the certificate.<br><br>
If Encrypt is true and Trust Server Certificate is not activated and if the server name in
 "Host name in certificate" doesn't match the server name in the TLS certificate, the following
 error will be issued: The driver couldn't establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: "java.security.cert.CertificateException: Failed to
 validate the server name in a certificate during Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) initialization.".
