<h2>Export From</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Combobox</b>
</li>In the combobox you can select the format of the "Export From" file (Calc,
 JFile, List, MobileDB, MS-Access, MS-Excel, Textfile, DBase3, DBase4, DBase5, FoxPro
 or XML).
<li><b>Filename / Open</b>
</li>You can use the Open button to select the database to be converted or type
 in the name of the database directly in the text field.<br>
<li><b>PDA Database Name</b>
</li>This field identifies the "Export From" file. For PDA databases this is
 the name of the database as it should appear on the PDA, for MS-Excel
 spreadsheets it represents the tabsheet label and for XML files the root-
element. If left unchanged, DBConvert uses this as default PDA database name for
 the export file. Should your export file require another name then you could
 enter the new name in this field.<br>	
<li><b>Encoding</b>
</li>Here you can override the default character set encoding of the "Export
 From" file. This feature can be very useful if your file was created on a
 computer that used a different character set encoding than your own. A good
 example of this is when you try to read an old DBase3 file under MS-Windows
 that was created under MS-DOS.

<h3>Export From MS-Access</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Password</b>
</li>Should your MS-Access database be password protected then you should enter
 the password in this field.
<li><b>Tables</b>
</li>If your MS-Access database has more than one table then you can select in
 this comboxbox the table to be exported.
</ul>

<h3>Export From Calc / MS-Excel</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Worksheet</b>
</li>In case your spreadsheet has more than one worksheet then you can select 
 in this comboxbox the worksheet to be exported.
</ul>

<h3>Export From TextFile</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Export Format</b>
</li>The export format specifies the the textfile format you are exporting from.
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Standard CSV File</b>
</li>Export from a standard CSV File, created for example by HanDBase, JFile,
 SmartList to Go, MS-Excel or other program.<br>
<li><b>Other</b>
</li>Exports from a delimited text file according to your own requirements.<br>
</ul>

<li><b>Other</b>
</li>The right part of the screen contains the options for exporting from
 another textfile format It contains of the following parts:
<ul>
<li><b>Field Separator</b>
</li> By selecting the field separator you can either export from a Comma-,
 Tab-, Semi colon- or pipe delimited file<br>
<li><b>Text Delimiter</b>
</li> This specifies the text delimiter (to enclose all database fields).<br>
</ul></ul>
</ul>

<p> 
<b>Important:</b> DBConvert checks whether the database file truly exists and
 whether its format corresponds with the selected database format. DBConvert is
 not able to read encrypted databases. When DBConvert opens a DBase or FoxPro
 database it tries to find the encoding that was used to create the database.
 If found, the encoding field will be set accordingly. Encoding is deactivated
 for XML files, because the XML Parser used by DBConvert recognises the correct
 encoding to be used automatically.
 </p> 
<p>
Dbase or FoxPro Memo fields that contain binary data (like OLE-Objects or
 pictures) are not supported, DBConvert can only read memo texts. DBConvert can
 read Visual FoxPro files, but doesn't support the non-standard xBase
 fieldtypes, like Currency, DateTime or Variant.
</p>
<p>
MS-Access passwords will be stored in the DBConvert database for your
 convenience. For security reasons the stored passworld will be encrypted. In
 case you've already defined the MS-Access database with a valid password before
 then DBConvert loads the password directly from the DBConvert database and
 deactivates the password field because there is no need to re-enter the
 password again.

<h2>Export To</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Combobox</b>
</li>In the combobox you can select the format of the "Export To" file
 (Calc, HanDBase, JFile, List, MobileDB, MS-Excel, Textfile, DBase3, DBase4, Dbase5,
 FoxPro or Xml).
<li><b>Filename / Open</b>
</li>You can use the Open button to select the database to export to or type in
 the name of the database directly in the text field.<br>
<li><b>Create Backup</b>
</li>Should the export file already exist then this option allows you to create
 a backup copy of the previous export file.  If you deactivate the option then
 the previous export file will be deleted.
<li><b>Encoding</b>
</li>Here you can override the default character set encoding for the "Export
 To" file. This feature can be very useful if the file to be exported will be
 used on another computer or OS that doesn't support the default characterset.
<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b> DBConvert verifies whether the export file exists and
 whether its format corresponds with the selected database format.
 DBConvert is not able to write encrypted databases<br>
