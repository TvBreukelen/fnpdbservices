<h1>JSON Sort Order</h2>

JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data
 objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with
 diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.

<h2>JSON Field Definition</h2>

<h3>Objects</h3>
In this screen you can define up to 4 fields to be used as sorted object. Each field you choose here, acts as an container
 for the objects to follow. If you've defined the same field on the "Export Fields" tab, the program will use the field
 header instead of the field name itself. 
<br>

<h3>Group by</h3>
If you not only want to sort the objects, but group them as well together under a certain name. You can activate the checkbox
 that follows the sorted object fields. Optionally, you group them by the name you'd specify in the text field next to it.
 In the example above, I've sorted my books by Author with Authors as group name. If the name field is left blank, the program
 uses the same name as the sorted object field.  
<br>

<h3>Remaining</h3>
Normally the last object to be sorted should be unique for each record. If there are duplicates then the program will group
 the remaining fields to be exported under the name you specify here in this field. If you leave it blank then "Values" will
 be used as default.
