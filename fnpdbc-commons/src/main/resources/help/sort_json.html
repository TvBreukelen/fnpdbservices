<h2>JSON Field Definition</h2>

JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data
 objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with
 diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.
<br><br>

<h3>Objects</h3>
In this screen you can define up to 4 fields to be used as sorted object. Each field you choose here, acts as an container
 for the objects to follow.
<br><br>

<h3>Example</h3>
Imagine that you are exporting a Books database, a logical element sort order would then be:<br><br>

Object 1: Author<br>
Object 2: Title

<p>The result would then be something like this:</p>
