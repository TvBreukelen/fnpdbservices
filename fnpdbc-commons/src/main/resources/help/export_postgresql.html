<h2>Export Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Into new table</b></li>
This option creates a new table and writes the records into it. Should the table already exists in the
 database then DBConvert/FNprog2PDA will overwrite it with a DROP/CREATE table.<br><br>
<b>Schema</b><br>
This button displays the SQL statement that will be used to create the [new] table.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b><br><br>
<img src="../images/Schema.png">
<br><br>
<li><b>Replace records in the table</b></li>
This option erases previous existing records in the table with a DELETE statement and writes the new
 records into it. Unlike the previous option it will keep the current table schema intact.
<br><br>
<li><b>Append records to the table</b></li>
With this option DBConvert/FNProg2PDA will try to insert new records into the table, while keeping the
 existing ones. 
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #ff0000">Warning</h2>
"Into new table" should be used with extreme care. The new table is created according to the basic
 specifications provided on the "Export Fields" tab. It doesn't respect pre-existing indices, triggers, 
 constraints or foreign keys. So, if you want to keep the existing table structure/schema intact but
 start with an empty table then you should use the second option instead.<br>

<h2>On Conflict</h2>
Modern databases alows you to specify what action should be taken if a conflict arises when trying to
 insert or update data into a table.
<ul>
<li><b>Ignore</b></li>
This option ignores the conflict and continues with the insertion. If a unique constraint is violated, then
 the row with the conflict is not inserted, but the rest of the rows are inserted.
<br><br>
<li><b>Replace</b></li>
This option replaces the existing row with the new row being inserted. If the row does not exist, then it
 is inserted as usual.
<br><br>
<li><b>Rollback</b></li>
This option rolls back the entire transaction if a conflict occurs.
</ul>
