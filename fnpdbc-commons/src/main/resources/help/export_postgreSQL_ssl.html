<h2>SSL</h2>
If your user has been setup by the database administrator to use SSL then here you can
 define which certificates DBConvert should use to connect to the database. You can setup
 DBConvert to use a one way or two way connection. Which one to use depends on the database
 and user configuration.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Use SSL</h3>
If you don't need to use SSL then leave this check box deactivated. If SSL is required you
 you'd need to activate it.
<br>
<br>
<h3>SSL private key</h3>
Provide the full path for the key file. Defaults to /defaultdir/postgresql.pk8.<br>
<b>Note:</b> The key file must be in PKCS-12 or in PKCS-8 DER format.
<h3>SSL CA certificate</h3>
File name of the SSL root certificate. Defaults to defaultdir/root.crt<br>
It can be a PEM encoded X509v3 certificate
<h3>SSL certificate</h3>
Provide the full path for the certificate file. Defaults to /defaultdir/postgresql.crt,
 where defaultdir is ${user.home}/.postgresql/ in *nix systems and %appdata%/postgresql/
 on windows.
<br>
<br>
It can be a PEM encoded X509v3 certificate
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> This parameter is ignored when using PKCS-12 keys, since in that case the certificate
 is also retrieved from the same keyfile.
<h3>SSL mode</h3>
Possible values include disable, allow, prefer, require, verify-ca and verify-full. require, allow
 and prefer all default to a non validating SSL factory and do not check the validity of the
 certificate or the host name. verify-ca validates the certificate, but does not verify the hostname.
 verify-full will validate that the certificate is correct and verify the host connected to has the
 same hostname as the certificate. Default is prefer.
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Setting these will necessitate storing the server certificate on the client machine.
