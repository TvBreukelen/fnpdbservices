<h2>List Sort Order</h2>
<p>List is a simple to use database that uses two custom fields and a large notes field. The beauty
 of List is that you can organize your database records by Category. Unfortunately the Palm Pilot
 Database structure limits the total number of user definable Categories to 15. All records that
 don't fall in these 15 Categories will be assigned to the default Palm "Unfiled" Category.

DBConvert and FNProg2PDA allows you to assign individual database fields of the original database
 to the List Category, Custom Field 1 and Field 2.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Category</b></li>
Here you could select a database field that you'd like to use as category in your List database (Optional).
<br>
<li><b>Field 1</b></li>
Here you can select the field that should be used as List's Custom Field 1
<br>
<li><b>Field 2</b></li>
Logically, this should then be the List Custom Field 2
</ul>
