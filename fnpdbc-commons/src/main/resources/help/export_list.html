<h1>Export To List</h1>
<h2>Export Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Into New Database</b></li>
This option creates a new database. Should a previous copy of the "Export To" database file already exist then
 DBConvert/FNprog2PDA will overwrite it.
<br>
<li><b>Into Current Database, Appending to existing records</b></li>
Similar as the previous option, but in this case the new records are appended to the existing records in the 
 database.
