<h1>Export To MovieBuddy</h1>
<p>
If you have selected the Contents table in the CATVids database, you'll have an additional CSV format option
 in the Texfile export to create a valid MovieBuddy import file. MovieBuddy is a powerful Movie and TV-Series
 collecting app that runs on the Apple iPhone and iPad. It is developed by Kimico,Ltd.

<h2>Export Format</h2>
Here you can select the text format to export to.<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Standard CSV File</b></li>Creates a standard CSV File that can be imported directly in HanDBase,
 JFile, SmartList to Go, MS-Excel or other program.<br><br>
<li><b>MovieBuddy</b></li>Creates a MovieBuddy compatible CSV file.<br><br>
<li><b>Other</b></li>Creates a delimited text file according to your own requirements.<br>
</ul>
<h2>Large File Split</h2>
Many import programs place a limit on the size of a texfile. Here you can define the maximum allowed
 file size limit, so that FNProg2PDA splits the textfile into smaller pieces in case the export file
 exceeds the file size limitation.
<h2>Other</h2>
The right part of the screen contains the options for setting up an export file to your own requirements
 It contains of the following parts
<ul>
<li><b>Field Separator</b></li>
By selecting the field separator you can either create a Comma-, Tab- or Semicolon- or Pipe delimited file
<br><br>
<li><b>Text Delimiter</b></li>
This specifies the text delimiter (to enclose all database fields).
<br><br>
<li><b>Include</b></li>
Here you specify whether the first line of your file should contain the database field 'Headers' and
 whether it is allowed that the export file contains line breaks (carriage return) characters.
<br>
</ul>
<h2>Notes:</h2>
If MovieBuddy is selected then FNProg2PDA will preload the minimal required fields to be exported and
sort order (by Video Title, DiscNo., ReleaseNo and Episode).

exported. In both cases a similar screen like the one below will be shown.
