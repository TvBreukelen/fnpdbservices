<h2>SSL</h2>
If your user has been setup by the database administrator to use SSL/TLS then here you can
 define which certificates DBConvert should use to connect to the database. You can setup
 DBConvert to use a one way or two way connection. Which one to use depends on the database
 and user configuration.
<br>
<br>
SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer whereas TLS refers to Transport Layer Security. Both are
 cryptographic protocols that authenticate data transfer between servers, systems, applications
 and users.<br><br>
For MariaDB connection we use only TLS with *.pem certificates.
<h3>Use SSL</h3>
If you don't need to use SSL then leave this check box deactivated. If SSL/TLS is required you
 you'd need to activate it.
<br>
<br>
Two-Way TLS means that both the client and server provide TLS certificates and keys. This basically
 means that you have to enter your SSL client certificate, the SSL client private key certificate
 and the certificate for a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
<br>
<br>
One-Way TLS means that only the server provides TLS certificates and keys. Server certificate
 verification means that the client verifies that the certificate belongs to the server. In that case
 you'd only need to enter here the certificate for a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) 
<h3>SSL private key</h3>
 Defines a path to a private key file to use for TLS. The key file must be unencrypted. This field
  requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path.
<h3>SSL CA certificate</h3>
Defines a path to a PEM file that should contain one or more X509 certificates for trusted
 Certificate Authorities (CAs) to use for TLS. This requires you to use the absolute path, not a
 relative path.</p>
<h3>SSL certificate</h3>
Defines a path to the X509 certificate file to use for TLS. This field requires that you use the
 absolute path, not a relative path
<h3>SSL cipher</h3>
Defines a comma separated list of permitted ciphers or cipher suites to use for TLS. If you leave all
 other fields blank then this allows you to establish One-Way TLS without Server Certificate Verification.
