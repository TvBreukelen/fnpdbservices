<h2>SSH tunnel</h2>
Use the fields in the SSH Tunnel tab to configure SSH Tunneling. You can use the "SSH
 Tunnel" tab to connect DBConvert (through an intermediary proxy host) to a server that
 resides on a network to which the client may not be able to connect directly.
<br>
<h3>Use SSH tunnel</h3>
If you don't need to use SSH then leave this check box deactivated. If SSH is required you
 you'd need to activate it.
<br>
<h3>SSH Host</h3>
Here you'd specify the name or IP address of the SSH host (through which client connections
 will be forwarded).
<br>
<h3>Port</h3>
Enter here port of the SSH Host through which client connections will be forwarded).
 The default port number is 22.
<br>
<h3>Username</h3>
In the Username field you'd specify the name of a user with login privileges for the SSH host.
<br>
<h3>Password</h3>
If the SSH host is expecting a password of the username or private key file (if being used),
 use the Password field to specify the password.
<br>
<h3>Private key file</h3>
If the SSH host is expecting a private key file for authentication, use this field to specify
 the location of the key file.
<br>
<h3>Local port</h3>
Here you'd enter the preferred local port for local port forwarding.
<br>
<br>
Local port forwarding allows you to forward a port on the local (ssh client) machine to a port
 on the remote (ssh server) machine, which is then forwarded to a port on the destination machine.
 In this forwarding type, the SSH client listens on a given port and tunnels any connection to
 that port to the specified port on the remote SSH server, which then connects to a port on the
 destination machine. The destination machine can be the remote SSH server or any other machine.
 Local port forwarding is mostly used to connect to a remote service on an internal network.
