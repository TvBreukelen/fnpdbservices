<h2>SSH tunnel</h2>
Use the fields in the SSH Tunnel tab to configure SSH Tunneling. You can use the "SSH
 Tunnel" tab to connect DBConvert (through an intermediary proxy host) to a server that
 resides on a network to which the client may not be able to connect directly.
<br>
<h3>Use SSH tunnel</h3>
If you don't need to use a SSH tunnel then leave this check box deactivated. If SSH is required you
 you'd need to activate it.
<br>
<h3>SSH Host</h3>
Here you'd specify the name or IP address of the SSH host (through which client connections
 will be forwarded).
<br>
<h3>Port</h3>
Enter here port of the SSH Host through which client connections will be forwarded).
 The default port number is 22.
<br>
<h3>Username</h3>
In the User name field you'd specify the name of a user with login privileges for the SSH host.
<br>
<h3>Password</h3>
If the SSH host is expecting a password for the user name or private key file (if being used),
 you can enter here the password. FYI: by default a private key file password is assumed.
<br>
<h3>Private key file</h3>
If the SSH host is expecting a private key file for authentication, use this field to specify
 the location of the key file. This should be an OpenSSH file. FYI: the most recent private key files
 created by PuTTY are incompatible. However, with the PuTTYGen program you can convert them to the
 correct OpenSSH format.
