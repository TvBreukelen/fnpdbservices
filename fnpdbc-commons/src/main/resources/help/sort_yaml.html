<h1>YAML Sort Order</h2>

YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications
 where data is being stored or transmitted. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact
 format that uses [...] for lists and {...} for maps.

<h2>YAML Field Definition</h2>

<h3>Objects</h3>
In this screen you can sort up to 4 different objects. If you've defined the same object on the "Export Fields" tab, the
 program will use the field header instead of the field name itself. 
<br>

<h3>Group by</h3>
If you not only want to sort the objects, but group them as well together under a certain name. You can activate the checkbox
 that follows the sorted object fields. Optionally, you group them by the name you'd specify in the text field next to it.
 In the example above, I've sorted my books by Author with Authors as group name. If the name field is left blank, the program
 uses the same name as the sorted object field.  
<br>

<h3>Remaining</h3>
Normally the last object to be sorted should be unique for each record. If there are duplicates then the program will group
 the remaining fields to be exported under the name you specify here in this field. If you leave it blank then "Values" will
 be used as default.
