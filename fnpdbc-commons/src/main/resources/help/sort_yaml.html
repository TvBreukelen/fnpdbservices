<h2>YAML Field Definition</h2>

YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications
 where data is being stored or transmitted. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact
 format that uses [...] for lists and {...} for maps.

<h3>Objects</h3>
In this screen you can define up to 4 fields to be used as sorted object. Each field you choose here, acts as an container
 for the objects to follow.
<br><br>

<h3>Example</h3>
Imagine that you are exporting a Books database, a logical element sort order would then be:<br><br>

Object 1: Author<br>
Object 2: Title

<p>The result would then be something like this:</p>
