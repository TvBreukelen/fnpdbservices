<h1>Add Relationship...</h1>
In this screen you can create a relationship between two tables. You can link data in one table to the
 data in another table by selecting a field (= column) in a table that points to a column with unique values
 in another table (often the primary key column) to create a way of cross-referencing the two tables.<br><br>

<h2>Notes</h2>
It is up to you to select to correct fields. Many databases allows you to define completely unrelated fields without
 issuing an error.  
<h2>Field Definition</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>From Table</b></li>
Allows you to select the table you are linking from (the "left" table). By default the first entry would be the
 current selected table. Other entries are the tables that you have previously linked to before.
<br><br>
<li><b>To Table</b></li>
Allows you to select the table you are linking to (the "right" table). These are all the tables in the database which
 haven't been linked before.
<br><br>
<li><b>From Field</b></li>
Here you can select the "From Table" field(s) used for linking with the "To Table". 
<br><br>
<li><b>To Field</b></li>
The "To Table" field(s) used for the link with the "From Table" can be selected here.
