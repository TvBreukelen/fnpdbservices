<h2>Export Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Into new database</b></li>
This option creates a new database. Should a previous copy of the "Export To" database file already exist then
 DBConvert/FNprog2PDA will overwrite it.
<br><br>
<li><b>Append records to database</b></li>
Similar as the previous option, but in this case the new records are appended to the existing records in the 
 database.
</ul>
<h2>Character set</h2>
Specifies the character set to be used for the xBase export. Default is MS-Windows Latin-1 which stands for
 character set "windows-1252" (also mistakingly called ANSI).
