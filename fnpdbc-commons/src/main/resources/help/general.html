<li><b>Time Format</b></li>
Here you can choose a 24 hours or AM/PM time format, with or without seconds,
<ol>
<li><b>hh:mm</b> (= hours:minutes in 24 hour format)</li>
<b>Examples:</b> 12:34 or "00:43"
<br>
<li><b>hh:mm:ss</b> (= hours:minutes:seconds in 24 hour format)</li>
<b>Examples:</b> 12:34:25 or "00:43:15"
<br>
<li><b>h:mm am/pm</b> (= hours:minutes in AM/PM hour format)</li>
<b>Examples:</b> 12:34 pm, "00:43 am"
<br>
<li><b>hh:mm</b> (= hours:minutes:seconds in AM/PM hour format)</li>
<b>Examples:</b> 12:34:25 pm, or "00:43:15 am"
<br>
</ol>
  
<br>
<li><b>Duration Format</b></li>
Here you can choose a time format to be used for the exported duration fields:
<ol>
<li><b>h:mm.ss</b> (= hours, minutes and seconds)</li>
<b>Examples:</b> 12:34:52, "2:39:05", "08:25" or "00:43"
<br>
<li><b>mmm.ss</b> (= minutes and seconds)</li>
<b>Examples:</b> "125:25", "95:24", "18:50 or "00:16"
<br> 
</ol>

<br>
<li><b>Boolean Values</b></li>
Enter here the values to be used as a text replacement for the boolean values True or False
</ul>

<h2>Internet - Automatically check for program updates</h2>
<p>
Here you could select how often the program should check automatically for updates
</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a day</li>
<li>Once a week</li>
<li>Once a month</li>
<li>Never</li>
</ul>

<h2>Folders</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>File Folder</b></li>
You can enter here the default folder for creating the DBConvert- or FNProg2PDA export files.
<br>
<li><b>Backup Folder</b></li>
This folder is used as a default location for your DBConvert and FNProg2PDA backup files.
<br>
<li><b>Image Folder</b></li>
Here you can specify the default folder in which FNProg2PDA should create the image (bmp, jpeg or png) files for HanDBase or
 P. Referencer and CSV files on your PC
<br> 
<li><b>Mobile Device Image Folder</b></li>
When used, the program still creates the image files in the Image Folder, but writes the 
 Mobile device image foldername + image filename in the export file instead. After copying the files manually on the mobile device in
 the folder (that is specified here), the database program on the mobile device should be able to retrieve the correct location
 of the image files automatically.
<br> 

</ul>
<h2>Export image file names without the path.</h2>
<ul>
<li>When selected, it removes the path information from the file name</li>
For example: image.jpeg instead of d:/data/images/image.jpeg
</ul>

<p><b>Notes:</b>
<p>
FNProg2PDA uses two internal date types, namely  "incomplete" and "standard" dates. Incomplete dates are
 dates in the FNProgramvare databases that don't need to be completely entered. For example: a published date,
 that is entered without a day, like 05.2006 (May, 2006). Standard dates are dates that need to be entered
 completely in the FNProgramvare database. For example: the due date of a reserved book.
</p> 
<p>
"Incomplete" date fields are always exported as text. "Standard" date fields however can be exported as text
 and (for some export file formats) also as date fields.
</p> 
<p>
The difference between time and duration is that duration represents the length of time of a CD, track or video)
 and time the time of a day. Duration fields are always exported as text. Time fields can either be exported to
 text and (for some export file formats) also as time fields.<br>
